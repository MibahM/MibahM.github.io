# MibahM.github.io

This project was developed with React.js. 

This is a website meant to showcase my experience and education using HTML and JavaScript to provide some functionality to the site. 

- The About me page shows my picture and some things about me that change upon each new visit to the page
- There is currently only a brief about me page and an experience page.
- While this site is in a working state, it is a WIP that I add new features to whenever I think of something interesting I want to add.
